# Fee Split (bridge revenues)

**Default split (subject to governance / timelock):**
- **60% → Liquidity Pot** (depth for wrapped pairs)
- **30% → Prover Bounties** (permissionless proving market)
- **10% → Ops/Insurance** (monitoring, audits, incident reserve)

**Cadence:** Distribute once daily based on realized fees.

**Addresses (placeholders):**
- `MULTISIG_LIQUIDITY_POT`
- `MULTISIG_PROVER_BOUNTY_VAULT`
- `MULTISIG_OPS_INSURANCE`

**Notes:** Operational/engineering guidance only; not a promise of returns.
